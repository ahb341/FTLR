# 1100 GPH Bilge Pump Focusing Nozzles

These nozzles are used to focus the water outlet down.  See [the goole sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-HefykKQcwzs_5saRSJ2ZGnsmRsN48gXgcHaITrTcGM/edit#gid=1478561639) for detailed calculations.

At time of Writing (before Checkpoint 1), it seems most likely to use the 0.53" plain nozzle.

## Laminizer

Little fins inside the nozzle to collect the flow and become more laminar.  However, increase friction on the fluid, ultimately decreasing thrust efficiency.
